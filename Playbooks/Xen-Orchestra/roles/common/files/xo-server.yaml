# Example XO-Server configuration.

# This file is automatically looking for at the following places:

# It may be necessary to run XO-Server as a privileged user (e.g.
# `root`) for instance to allow the HTTP server to listen on a
# [privileged ports](http://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Installation/PrivilegedPorts.html).
#
# To avoid security issues, XO-Server can drop its privileges by
# changing the user and the group is running with.
#
# Note: XO-Server will change them just after reading the
# configuration.
